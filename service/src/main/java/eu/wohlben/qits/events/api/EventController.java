 * {@code quarkus.rest.path}, not spelled here, so this class carries only its own noun.
 *
 * <p>Request and response shapes are nested records, the platform's controller idiom: the wire
 * contract for one operation lives beside the method that serves it, and the generated OpenAPI
 * document names them after the operation rather than after a bag of shared DTOs.
 *
 * <p><b>There are two writes and they are not two spellings of one.</b> {@code POST} records an
 * event under an id this service picks — the manual path, for a person or a script with nothing to
 * retry. {@code PUT /{id}} is the bus's publish: the id is the <em>publisher's</em> UUID and is the
 * idempotency key, which is what lets a publisher that lost the answer to its first attempt send the
 * same bytes again and be told 200 rather than write a second row.

  /**
   * The log, newest first, one page at a time — and, with {@code ?parentId=<id>}, the events that
   * <em>one</em> event caused, which is the downward half of a chain walk.
   *
   * <p>Every filter is a query parameter on the route that already exists rather than a route of its
   * own, and that is not only economy: a new literal under {@code /events} would need an entry in
   * {@code quarkus.quinoa.ignored-path-prefixes} in the same commit, which is this platform's
   * standing trap. Parameters need none, so none of this touches that key.
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code ?limit=} — page size. Absent is 200, above 1000 is 1000, and anything that is not a
   *       whole number at least 1 is a 400. It was silently <em>unknown</em> before this — the
   *       method declared {@code parentId} alone, so JAX-RS dropped it and answered with all of
   *       history while the client believed it had asked for ten rows.
   *   <li>{@code ?cursor=<occurredAt>,<id>} — resume after the previous page's last row. Composite
   *       because {@code occurredAt} ties; see {@code EventCursor}.
   *   <li>{@code ?order=asc} — oldest first. Absent or {@code desc} is the reading this route has
   *       always answered, byte for byte. Ascending exists for <b>durable consumers catching up</b>:
   *       a consumer that keeps the last row it handled as a watermark reads <em>forward</em> from
   *       it until it reaches the head, which descending cannot express. The cursor is the same
   *       value in both directions — the page's last row — and the comparison flips with the sort,
   *       so a tie splits across a page boundary exactly as safely; see {@code EventOrder}. Anything
   *       that is neither spelling is a 400 naming the parameter, because answering with the
   *       opposite direction would let a catch-up consumer record a watermark it never reached.
   *   <li>{@code ?name=A,B} — the same vocabulary the stream's subscribe frame uses, so a filter
   *       means one thing live and historically. {@code GET /events/names} lists it.
   *   <li>{@code ?since=} — an inclusive lower bound on {@code occurredAt}. There is no upper bound
   *       parameter; the cursor is the upper bound.
   *   <li>{@code ?q=} — a case-insensitive substring of the payload, which this service stores and
   *       hands back as an opaque string and does not parse here either.
   *   <li>{@code ?attr=<key>=<value>} — repeatable, ANDed. An exact match of the fragment {@code
   *       "key":"value"} in the payload, case-insensitive. This service still parses no payload: it
   *       builds a literal whose shape the platform's own canonical-JSON publisher guarantees, so it
   *       works for string-valued keys of events published through {@code CanonicalJson} and nothing
   *       else, and it is a scan like {@code ?q=} rather than an indexed lookup. A value with no
   *       {@code =} is a 400 naming the parameter.
   *   <li>{@code ?environment=} — exact match on the tier the publisher stamped ({@code dev},
   *       {@code platform}). Envelope data on its own column, so unlike {@code ?q=} and {@code
   *       ?attr=} it is an indexed equality, not a payload scan. A value that could never have been
   *       stored — not a dns-safe name — is a 400 naming the parameter. Events recorded before the
   *       platform knew tiers carry null and match no filter value.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>{@code ?parentId=} is answered whole and takes none of them.</b> A parent's children are
   * one per artifact a pipeline declares — bounded by a file in a repository, not by history — so
   * paging them would be a parameter that never fires, and {@code nextCursor} is null on that
   * answer. An unknown parent gives an empty list, not a 404; blank is treated as absent, so {@code
   * ?parentId=} is a client that meant to ask for everything.
   *
   * <p>There is deliberately no chain, depth or root endpoint; upwards is {@code GET /{id}}
   * following {@code parentId}, downwards is this, and a client that walks either <b>must bound its
   * own depth and remember the ids it has seen</b>, because nothing here prevents a cycle.
