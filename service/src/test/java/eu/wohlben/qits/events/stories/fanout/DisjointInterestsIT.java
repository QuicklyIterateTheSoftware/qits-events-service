/**
 * <b>Routing on this bus is the event's signature and each connection's own subscription set, and
 * nothing else.</b> There are no topics here, no exchanges, no per-consumer queue — {@code
 * EventStreamSubscriptions} is one {@code Map<connectionId, Set<signature>>} in one process, and a
 * publish walks it. That is the whole routing table, so the only thing worth proving about it is the
 * thing a table cannot state: that an event reached the connections that asked for it and <b>no
 * others</b>.
 *
 * <h2>Why three connections and not two</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two of them are selective and each is proven live: the build watcher and the release watcher
 * both receive the warm-up handshake, then each receives its own signature and stays silent through
 * the other's. That is <em>selectivity</em>, and it is what makes each one's silence evidence rather
 * than an empty queue.
 *
 * <p>The third has named nothing at all. {@code EventStreamSubscriptions.opened} puts a connection
 * in the table with an <b>empty</b> set, so it is subscribed to nothing until it says otherwise —
 * silence is the honest default for a connection that has not said what it wants, and it is what
 * keeps a browser tab that merely opened the socket out of the fan-out. It dials with the
 * <em>person's</em> credential, because that is who that tab belongs to and because the socket's
 * door really does take {@code qits:admin} beside {@code qits:system}.
 *
 * <p><b>And it is the one this story makes a diagram-level claim about.</b> {@code
 * assertNoEdgesTo("a tab that only opened the socket")} says nothing was ever pushed to it — a claim
 * that would be worthless from a client nobody could see, and is not, because that client is a
 * {@code FakeSubscriber} with the tap inside it, connected for the whole story, while two sibling
 * connections were drawing {@code event} arrows the entire time. A tap that could have seen the edge
 * and did not is the only kind of absence worth putting in a report.
 *
 * <h2>What is out of reach</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Fan-out across two instances of this service</b>, because there is no such thing:
 * subscriptions are in-memory and single-process by design (a subscription is worth exactly as long
 * as the connection holding it, so there is nothing to replicate), and a second instance would need
 * a real broker rather than a shared table. That is a different feature, and this story would be the
 * one to grow when it arrives.

      """
      Three connections are open on the one bus at the same time, and they want different things.

      One names the build signature, one names the release signature, and one names nothing at
      all — a browser tab that opened the socket and never sent a subscribe frame, which on this
      protocol means subscribed to nothing rather than subscribed to everything. All three are
      authorised: the socket's door takes the machine role and the person's alike, so the tab is
      a legitimate connection and not an intruder.

      Both watchers first prove themselves live the only way this protocol allows — by being
      pushed a handshake event they both named, because a subscribe frame is answered with
      silence and a publish that raced one would look exactly like a broken fan-out.

      Then a build event is published. The build watcher is pushed it; the release watcher is
      not, and its silence means SELECTIVITY rather than a dead socket, because a release event
      published straight afterwards reaches it and only it. One publish, one matching
      connection, one frame.

      And through all of it the tab is told nothing. That is the claim this story exists for, and
      it is a claim about traffic that did not happen — which only means something because the
      tab is a real client with the report's own tap inside it, connected the whole time, while
      two connections beside it were being pushed frames.
