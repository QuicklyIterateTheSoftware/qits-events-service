 *
 * <p>{@code PackagedSurfaceIT} beside it already probes the artifact's <em>surface</em> — the client
 * at the root, the prefixes SPA routing must not swallow, a socket that upgrades. What it does not do
 * is tell a story: it is a list of properties, each true on its own, and the thing qits-events
 * actually promises the fleet is the order they happen in. That order is what is here.
 *
 * <p><b>This class is the catalogue's oldest and not its owner.</b> It shares {@link StoryProfile}
 * with every story class under {@code eu.wohlben.qits.events.stories}, which is what makes them one
 * launched process, one database and — the part that matters most on this service — <b>one in-memory
 * subscription registry</b>: the fan-out table lives in the process, so a second profile would be a
 * second bus, and a subscriber connected to one would be invisible to a publish that reached the
 * other. Its {@code @TestMethodOrder} is for reproducibility of the emitted reports only: every edge
 * in this catalogue is observed as it happens, so nothing depends on which story drains first.

      One qits-events serves the whole platform, and every sibling service reaches it through the
      qits-eventstream jar it carries. This is the round trip that jar is written against.

      A durable consumer opens the stream with its machine bearer and names
      the signatures it cares about. A publisher's outbox then PUTs an event under a UUID IT
      chose — the id is the idempotency key, which is what makes a retry safe — and the consumer
      is pushed the envelope while the write is still warm.

      Then the publisher's first attempt is retried, because a network dropped the answer rather
      than the request. The same id and the same bytes come back 200 instead of 201, nothing is
      written, and — the half that matters to every subscriber on the platform — NOTHING IS
      PUSHED. A consumer must not see an event twice because an acknowledgement went missing.

      Finally the consumer goes away, as a redeploy makes it, and comes back holding nothing but
      a watermark: the last row it handled. It reads the log FORWARD from there — ascending,
      which is the direction that exists for exactly this — and finds the event it would
      otherwise have missed, once, with the publisher's own bytes intact. Live delivery and
      catch-up are two readings of one log, and a consumer that used both must never see a row
      twice or miss one.

      The flip side of a bus whose write is safe to retry. Idempotency is only worth something
      if the server can tell a retry from a lie, and this is where that line is drawn — plus the
      doors, which decide who is allowed to draw near it at all.

      A UUID reused for different content is refused with 400 and not with a conflict to sit and
      poll on: no retry fixes a publisher that reused an id, so telling it to try again would be
      a wait with no end. The comparison covers the occurrence and not the prose about it —
      change the payload and it is a different claim about history; change the CAUSE and it is a
      different claim about history too, which is why parentId sits inside the comparison, and
      the TIER sits inside it for the same reason. An id that is not a UUID at all never gets
      that far: on this route the id IS the idempotency key, and a caller that cannot spell one
      has no retry-safe identity to offer. Nor may an event be its own cause.

      Two shapes are refused before any lookup, and both are refusals of things this service
      could never have stored: an environment that is not a dns-safe name, and — on the read
      side — a misspelled `order`, which is refused for the reason the parameter exists, because
      answering it with the opposite direction would hand a catch-up consumer the head of the log
      and let it record a watermark it never reached. A cursor that is not `<occurredAt>,<id>`
      goes the same way.

      And the doors, which only a deployed process has. Publishing is the machine role's; a
      caller with no bearer is challenged at the socket's handshake and at the write alike — and
      so is one that forges the old X-Qits-User / X-Qits-Roles pair, which is not a credential —
      and a person's session — named, trusted, holding the role that reads every page of the
      events client — still cannot put anything into the log. The log is written by services and
