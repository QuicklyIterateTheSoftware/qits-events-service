      """
      A nightly pipeline ran and something about it is being asked after. Three events came out
      of it: the run itself, and two things it caused — an artifact published from the dev tier
      and a deployment finished on the platform tier, each carrying the run's id as its
      `parentId`.

      An operator opens the events client. First the vocabulary: which names does this log hold?
      That is the same list a subscriber may name in a subscribe frame, so a filter means one
      thing live and historically.

      Then the log itself, newest first, and then narrowed three different ways whose costs are
      not the same and whose differences the client's user has to understand. `?environment=` is
      an indexed equality on a column of its own. `?q=` is a substring of the payload, which this
      service stores as an opaque string and never parses — there is no single key meaning "which
      repository" to project anyway, since a build names it `repoId` and a release names it
      `repository`. And `?attr=key=value` is the exact question `?q=` cannot answer: it matches
      the literal `"key":"value"` with the CLOSING QUOTE included, so asking for `packageType=dae`
      finds no `daemon`.

      Then the chain, which is two directions and deliberately no endpoint of its own. Upwards is
      the `GET /{id}` that already existed, following `parentId`. Downwards is `?parentId=` on the
      list route, answered whole rather than paged, because a parent's children are bounded by a
      file in a repository rather than by history. A parent nothing names gives an empty list and
      not a 404 — this service does not know whether such an id is wrong, not here yet, or from a
      publisher it has never heard from, and "nothing was caused by it as far as I know" is the
      true answer in all three cases.

      And last, the doors, which are not one door. The list route admits a machine, because a
      durable consumer catching up IS a machine reading the log. The vocabulary and the
      single-row read do not: a consumer already knows the signatures it subscribes to, and it
      reads pages rather than rows. Each door is decided on the caller's bearer, by the tenant the
      artifact ships.
