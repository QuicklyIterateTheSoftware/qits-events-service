/**
 * <b>"Only a create broadcasts" is the clause every subscriber on this platform is written against,
 * and it is an absence — which is the one thing a presence check cannot state and a passively
 * captured diagram cannot draw.</b> This class turns it into evidence.
 *
 * <h2>Two stories, ONE connection, and that is the whole design</h2>
 *
 * <p>A negative claim about a push is only worth something if a tap could have seen the push. So the
 * first story opens a connection subscribed to {@code ["*"]} — <b>everything</b>, so that nothing
 * selective can explain a later silence — and proves it live the only way this protocol allows, by
 * being pushed frames for both of the service's write paths. The second story then does every other
 * thing this service can be asked to do <em>on that same connection</em>, and claims, at the level of
 * the diagram, that <b>no arrow reached it</b>.
 *
 * <p><b>The connection is the evidence. Do not close it between the two stories</b>, and do not
 * reorder them: {@code @TestMethodOrder} here is load-bearing rather than cosmetic, which is the one
 * place in this catalogue that is true. A reconnect between them would restore the flake this design
 * exists to remove — a fresh subscription cannot be proven live without a frame, and a frame is
 * exactly the arrow the second story says is absent.
 *
 * <h2>Why the claim is {@code assertNoEdgesTo} and never {@code assertNoEdgesFrom(SERVICE)}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the second one would be false. qits-events answers nothing without its store: a replay
 * is a lookup, a refusal on content is a comparison against a row, a delete is a delete. Every story
 * in this catalogue declares that {@code jdbc} edge where it incurs it, a declared edge counts in
 * {@code assertNoEdgesFrom}, and it should — the claim is "nothing left this process", and something
 * did. What is true, and is the claim actually worth making, is that nothing left this process
 * <em>towards the subscriber</em>.

      A consumer opens the stream and subscribes to `["*"]` — everything there is. That is a
      deliberate choice and not laziness: what comes next is a story about silence, and a
      connection that had named signatures could always be silent because it named the wrong
      ones.

      Two rows are then written, by the two paths this service has, and the consumer is pushed
      both. `PUT /{id}` is the bus's publish, under the publisher's own UUID. `POST` is the
      manual record path — a person or a script with nothing to retry — and it announces too,
      because the CDI signal is fired from EventService rather than from either boundary, so the
      two write paths cannot drift apart about what an event IS or about who gets told.

      That is the whole of this story, and its purpose is to leave a connection open that is
      demonstrably receiving. The story after it needs exactly that, and cannot build it for
      itself.

      The same connection, still open, still subscribed to everything, and demonstrably receiving
      a moment ago. Now the bus is asked for everything else it can do.

      A publisher retries an attempt whose answer was lost: same id, same bytes, 200 rather than
      201. Nothing is written, and NOTHING IS PUSHED — a subscriber must not see an event twice
      because an acknowledgement went missing, and that clause is the reason a publisher's retry
      is safe at all.

      A publisher reuses a UUID for different content and is refused: 400, no row, no frame.

      A caller with no bearer is challenged, and a person's session — named, trusted,
      holding the role that reads every page of the events client — is forbidden. Neither
      reaches a row, so neither could have announced one, and the diagram says so.

      A person reads the log. A read is a read: it produces no row and therefore no frame, which
      is worth stating because a bus that echoed its own reads back onto the stream would loop
      the whole platform.

      And a person DELETES a row. This is the sharp one: only a CREATE broadcasts, so a removal
      is announced to nobody. A consumer that already handled that row is never told it went
      away and its watermark is not rewound by the deletion — the log is append-only to every
      reader of the stream, whatever an operator does to it afterwards.
