/**
 * The surface of the <em>packaged artifact</em> — the fast-jar under {@code ./mvnw verify
 * -DskipITs=false}, the GraalVM binary under {@code -Dnative} — because that is the only place a
 * whole class of failure is visible.
 *
 * <p>Every other test here is a {@code @QuarkusTest}: it augments and runs in the build JVM, with
 * the full classpath present, reflection unrestricted, its datasource keys handed to it by a config
 * source — and, crucially, <b>Quinoa disabled</b>. Quinoa is off by default in test mode, so no
 * {@code @QuarkusTest} in this repo has ever seen the client at all; a unit test asserting something
 * about the served client would pass against a process with no client in it. What the SPA is
 * actually served as is proven here or nowhere.
 *
 * <p><b>The client is served at the root</b> since this service got a host of its own
 * ({@code events.<env>.<domain>}). The segment survives only as the wire prefix, which is what the
 * probe list below turns on:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code /} → 200 HTML carrying {@code <base href="/">} — the client's own spelling, set in
 *       another repository's {@code angular.json}, where no build here can check it. Wrong, and the
 *       page loads and then fetches its JavaScript from nowhere.
 *   <li>a deep link, scoped and unscoped → 200 {@code index.html}, so the Angular router owns it
 *       across a reload
 *   <li>{@code /events/} → 404: the whole segment is ignored by SPA routing now, so the old address
 *       is not a second door into the client. The edge sends the bookmark on with a redirect.
 *   <li>{@code /events/api/<real>} → the API's own answer; {@code /events/api/nope} → 404 and not
 *       the client. A machine client parses {@code index.html} as data.
 *   <li>the readiness endpoint the deployer's health gate curls, at the address the deployment
 *       assumes
 *   <li>{@code /events/stream}: a plain GET → 404 and not the client, and the upgrade → a working
 *       socket. Two probes rather than one, because they fail for opposite reasons —
 *       websockets-next claims only the <em>handshake</em>, so the plain GET is the Quinoa question
 *       and the upgrade is the "did the endpoint survive augmentation and the native image?"
 *       question. qits-ci learned the first by measuring it: before the prefix was ignored, a plain
 *       GET on its daemon socket answered 200 {@code index.html} from a green build.
 *   <li>{@code /events/api/stream}, the SSE transport of the same fan-out → never the client. It
 *       sits inside {@code quarkus.rest.path} and therefore inside the ignored prefix already, so
 *       nothing had to move for it — but it is a plain {@code GET} with no upgrade to distinguish
 *       it from a page request, which makes it the most exposed surface here to the SPA catch-all
 *       and the reason the probe is asserted rather than reasoned about.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>ITs are skipped by default ({@code skipITs} in the root pom) because they need a `package`, and
 * a package here needs the webui submodule and a node on PATH — neither of which the clone-alone
 * rule promises. Ask for them explicitly.
