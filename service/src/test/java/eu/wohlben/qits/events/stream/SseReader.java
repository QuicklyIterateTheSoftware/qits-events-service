/**
 * A browser's {@code EventSource}, as far as this server can tell: a plain credentialed {@code GET}
 * that reads {@code text/event-stream} off the wire and parses it by hand.
 *
 * <p><b>Deliberately raw.</b> It does not use a JAX-RS {@code SseEventSource} — this repository has
 * no REST client on its classpath and must not grow one for a test — and, more to the point, a typed
 * client would hide the very thing worth pinning. The SSE framing <em>is</em> the contract here: an
 * {@code id:} field carrying the event id, a {@code data:} field carrying the envelope's own JSON
 * bytes and nothing wrapped around them, and comment lines that no listener ever sees. Parsing the
 * lines is what makes those assertable.
 *
 * <p>{@link java.net.http.HttpClient} with {@code BodyHandlers.ofLines()} returns as soon as the
 * response <em>head</em> is written, which is why the server flushes an opening comment: without it
 * {@link #open} would block on a stream that is behaving perfectly. A daemon thread drains the line
 * stream into a queue, so the test thread can assert on arrival <em>and</em> on silence.
 *
 * <p>{@link #close} calls {@code shutdownNow}, which drops the connection — the server sees the
 * close, cancels the {@code Multi}, and the sink leaves the subscription table. A test can assert
 * that departure through {@code EventStreamSubscriptions.subscriberCountFor}.
