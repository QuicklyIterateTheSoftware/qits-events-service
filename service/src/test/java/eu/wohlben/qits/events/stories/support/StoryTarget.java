/**
 * The one launched qits-events, as every story in this catalogue addresses it and as every diagram
 * names it.
 *
 * <h2>This service is NOT a leaf, and that is the whole shape of the catalogue</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every sibling repository's catalogue stands a mock where its upstream would be, and its
 * negative claims are about what the service under test <em>dialled</em>. qits-events dials nobody:
 * it has no upstream, its callers are the qits-eventstream jars inside every other service, and the
 * only host it reaches is the postgres its own datasource names. But it is not a leaf either — <b>it
 * pushes</b>, and a pushed frame is an arrow leaving this process that a diagram must be able to
 * draw. So this catalogue has two taps and they see opposite halves of the same connection:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link eu.wohlben.qits.userflows.NetworkTaps#restAssured} — the shipped incoming tap. Every
 *       request a story sends becomes {@code <actor> -> qits-events}, labelled {@code METHOD
 *       <scrubbed path> -> <status>} with the status this service really answered.
 *   <li>{@code stream/FakeSubscriber} — the far side of the socket, and the only code that can see
 *       one. A RestAssured filter cannot see a websocket at all, so the dial, the refused upgrade
 *       and every pushed frame are reported to {@link eu.wohlben.qits.userflows.NetworkCapture} from
 *       inside that client.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Which is what makes this catalogue's negative claims mean something.</b> {@code
 * assertNoEdgesTo(<a consumer>)} is not the absence of a tap — it is a tap that was installed,
 * connected and demonstrably receiving at the moment the story says nothing arrived. Every story
 * below that makes such a claim pairs it with a sibling connection (or a sibling story on the very
 * same connection) that <em>did</em> receive, because otherwise "nothing was pushed" and "nobody was
 * listening" are the same sentence.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code assertNoEdgesFrom(SERVICE)} is deliberately used nowhere here.</b> It would be false:
 * this service answers nothing without its store, and every story declares that {@code jdbc} edge
 * (see {@link #STORE}) exactly where it incurs it. A declared edge counts in {@code
 * assertNoEdgesFrom}, and it should — the claim is "nothing left this process", and something did.
 *
 * <h2>One process, one port, three surfaces</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>the log's JSON API</b> — {@link #EVENTS} and what hangs off it, under {@code
 *       quarkus.rest.path=/events/api}.
 *   <li><b>the bus</b> — {@link #STREAM}, which does <em>not</em> follow {@code quarkus.rest.path}:
 *       a {@code @WebSocket} path registers straight onto the router and carries the {@code /events}
 *       segment itself, which is why it is spelled in full rather than built from a relative one.
 *   <li><b>the probes</b> — {@link #READY}, at {@code /events/q}, which the shipped tap skips.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>The shipped tap's default skip was checked here</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code NetworkTaps.restAssured(String)} skips any path carrying a {@code /q/} <b>segment</b>
 * rather than a leading one, which is exactly this service's case: {@code
 * quarkus.http.non-application-root-path=/events/q}, nested under the application root. No route of
 * this service can contain a {@code /q/} segment otherwise — every literal is authored and every
 * free segment is a UUID. So no story class overrides the predicate.
 *
 * <h2>Labels: what survives, what is rewritten, and what must never appear</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>A query string never reaches an incoming label</b> — the shipped tap labels {@code METHOD
 * <scrubbed path> -> <status>} and drops the query entirely. On <em>this</em> service that is the
 * single most load-bearing fact about the diagram, because the whole read model is query
 * parameters: {@code ?name=}, {@code ?order=}, {@code ?cursor=}, {@code ?limit=}, {@code ?attr=},
 * {@code ?environment=}, {@code ?parentId=}. A replay from a watermark, a page of the head of the
 * log and an operator's attribute search are therefore <b>one arrow</b>, told apart by their actor,
 * their status and the notes beside them. That is the right division and not a loss: a cursor is a
 * run-local value, and a label carrying one would move the story's {@code networkHash} on every run.
 *
 * <p><b>Every run-local value this service mints is a UUID</b> — an event id, and a {@code parentId}
 * which is another event's id — and {@link Labels#scrub} already rewrites a UUID in both positions
 * it can appear (a whole path segment, and a query value). So there is nothing left for a normalizer
 * to do, and {@link #NORMALIZER} is claimed as the identity rather than left unset: the slot is a
 * single JVM-wide one, and claiming it from {@link StoryNetwork#install()} is what stops a story
 * class quietly installing a second. {@link #served} runs an assertion's expected label through
 * <em>that same</em> pair of functions in the same order, so an assertion and an observation cannot
 * disagree about what a generated segment became — including if the slot is ever given a job.
 *
 * <p><b>One authored id is deliberately unscrubbable and that is the point.</b> The publish route's
 * "an id that is not a UUID" arm sends the literal {@code not-a-uuid}: a bare number would be
 * rewritten to {@code {id}} and the diagram would show a well-formed id being refused. The literal
 * survives, so the refusal reads as what it is.
 *
 * <h2>What a caller is</h2>
 *
 * <p>A caller is <b>a bearer token</b>, checked by the shipped OIDC tenant (epic qits-543,
 * qits-1363: the forwarded {@code X-Qits-User} / {@code X-Qits-Roles} pair authenticates nothing).
 * Each one is signed with the suite's own key ({@code security/BearerTokens}) and its {@code groups}
 * are the roles the caller means; {@link StoryProfile} hands the launched tenant the public half.
 * The key pair exists for this suite only and protects nothing, so there is nothing for {@code
 * assertNotLeaked} to protect either — and no label carries a token, because the shipped tap labels
 * method, path and status alone. What every story does assert instead is the other half of the same
 * discipline: the <b>generated event ids</b> a story minted appear in no file of its bundle at all.
 * Notes never interpolate one (a note enters the definition hash) and every label scrubs one, so a
 * leak is precisely the symptom of a hash that will never settle.
