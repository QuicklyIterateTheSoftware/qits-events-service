   *       arriving twice, because the publisher's first attempt got no answer. Nothing is written and
   *       <b>nothing is announced</b> ({@link PublishOutcome#REPLAYED}, 200): a subscriber must not
   *       see an event twice because a network dropped an acknowledgement;

   * <p><b>{@code description} is deliberately outside the comparison; {@code parentId}, {@code

   * prose about it. Description is the human account; a publisher that improves its wording on a
   * retry has not published a different event. A parent is on the identity side: it is
   * machine-consumed structure, it is the edge a chain is drawn from, and two PUTs of one id
   * claiming different causes are two different claims about history — kept outside, the server
   * would silently keep the first and answer 200 while the publisher believed it had published the
   * second, which is two services disagreeing about the shape of history with no error anywhere.
   * The environment sits on the same side by the same argument: which tier something happened in is
   * machine-consumed structure, and one id claiming two tiers is two claims about history. So does
   * the publisher: one id dispatched by two services is two claims about who said it. The
   * strictness costs a well-behaved publisher nothing: an outbox stores the envelope whole, so its
   * own two attempts cannot disagree.
   *
   * <p>The stored description is left as it was — a replay writes nothing at all, which is what
   * makes 200 free of a transaction.
   *
   * <p>{@code payload} is compared as an opaque string. This server never canonicalizes it; the
   * publisher does, and both sides of the equality are therefore the publisher's own bytes.
   *
   * <p><b>This is the platform's hub write</b> — every outbox in the fleet retries against it — so
   * the whole decision runs inside {@link DbRetry#inNewTx}. A connection lost while the row is being
   * written is held through rather than answered as a 500, which is the difference between one
   * pause here and a retry storm across every publisher. The retried body is the lookup and the
   * insert; validation and the parent check stay outside it, where a 400 costs no transaction.
