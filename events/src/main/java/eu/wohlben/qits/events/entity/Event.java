 * by Hibernate. Collapsing them would make a backfilled event indistinguishable from one recorded as
 * it happened, which is the one distinction an event log exists to keep.
 *
 * <p>No relation to any other context's entity, and there will not be one: an event that names a
 * project or a repository names it by String id through this context's own column, because those
 * rows live in another physical database (the platform-wide rule — see AGENTS.md).
