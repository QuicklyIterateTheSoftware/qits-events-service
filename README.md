# qits-events-platform-service

The **event** context of [qits](https://github.com/QuicklyIterateTheSoftware): a recorded thing that
happened, kept where the rest of the platform can read it.

It is a **skeleton**, and deliberately so. Unlike its siblings this repo was not extracted from the
monorepo with a body of code already in it — it starts as the *shape* every qits service has, with
the smallest amount of behaviour that makes that shape real, so the first feature is written against
a structure that is already right rather than one invented under pressure. What is here is the whole
of what is here; nothing below describes a plan.

## What it owns

| | |
|---|---|
| `Event` | a name, an `occurredAt`, an optional `payload`, an optional description, an optional `parentId` and an optional `environment` — plus the row's own `createdAt`/`updatedAt` |

The three timestamps are not redundant. `occurredAt` is the **caller's** — when the thing happened,
supplied on write and freely in the past, because a log is mostly written after the fact — while
`createdAt`/`updatedAt` are the row's, written by Hibernate. Collapse them and a backfilled event
becomes indistinguishable from one recorded as it happened, which is the one distinction an event
log exists to keep. Listing is ordered by `occurredAt`, never by insertion — and then by `id`,
because `occurredAt` ties: the events one pipeline run publishes carry the run's finish instant.

`parentId` is the id of the event that **caused** this one, or null for a root — the platform's
causation edge, and the one relation this table has. It records what a timeline cannot: a release
train is an event firing a build, the build publishing an event, that event firing another build,
and without the edge each hop is an unrelated row distinguishable from coincidence only by reading
timestamps and guessing.

`environment` is the tier the publisher ran in — `dev`, or `platform` for a service that serves
every tier — or null for an event recorded before the platform knew tiers. Since the bus became one
instance for the whole platform, this field is the only place a tier appears at all. Like
`parentId` it is envelope rather than payload, it sits inside the replay comparison, and it names a
row of another context's store (qits-deployments' environments) by value with no FK and no
existence check: only its *shape* is validated (a dns-safe name), because an environment can be
deleted after its events truthfully happened. `?environment=` on the list route filters by it,
as an indexed equality on its own column.

**A `parentId` this log cannot resolve is data, not an error, and there is no foreign key.** Nothing
orders a parent's arrival before its child's — publishes are independent HTTP calls, and a parent
whose first attempt failed sits in the publisher's outbox for minutes while its child lands on the
first try. An existence check would refuse that child with a 400, which is unretryable, so the
publisher's outbox would mark it FAILED and a timing accident would become permanent data loss. The
same argument covers the first retention policy and a parent from a publisher this instance never
heard from. A reader treats an unresolvable parent as the start of the chain.

## What it deliberately does NOT own

Any relation to another context's rows. An event that comes to name a project, a repository or a
deployment will name it by **String id** in a column of its own — those rows live in another
physical database and no foreign key can span one. That is the platform-wide rule, not a
this-repo preference.

Any *view* of a causation chain. There is no `/chain` route, no depth parameter, no root filter and
no graph endpoint: `parentId` on a read walks upwards, `?parentId=` walks downwards, and a tree
endpoint would have to settle depth limits, cycle handling and ordering before anyone has drawn the
picture. **Nor is there a cycle guard.** One that caught only the self-edge would be worse than
none — it cannot see `A → B → A` while telling a reader that cycles have been handled — so a
chain-walking client bounds its own depth and remembers the ids it has visited.

There is no MCP server here. That was true of the websocket too until this service became the
platform's **bus**, and the sentence is worth keeping in its new form: a literal route is not free.
`/events/stream` earned its place by being the only way an event can reach anything without being
polled for, and it cost an entry in `quarkus.quinoa.ignored-path-prefixes` in the same commit.

## Layout

    events/   the entity, persistence, control, mapper and dto — a library jar, no JAX-RS
    service/  the REST boundary over it, the client, and the security mechanism — THE APPLICATION

`service/` carries `<packaging>quarkus</packaging>` and produces a process, as a JVM fast-jar or as
a native binary:

    ./mvnw verify
    java -jar service/target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar          # :8080

    ./mvnw package -Dnative
    ./service/target/qits-events                                  # same routes

**Native is the shipping form.** `.sdkmanrc` names a GraalVM (`25.0.2-graalce`) so `sdk env` alone
is enough toolchain — the build wants a `native-image` on `GRAALVM_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH`, and
if it finds none it does not fail, it quietly falls back to pulling a 1.8 GB Mandrel image and
running the compile under docker. That fallback still works; it is just not the intended path, and
it is worth recognising by name when a compile that normally takes about a minute starts downloading
a container image.

This service has a **host of its own** — `events.<env>.<domain>` — and serves two planes on it:

| | |
|---|---|
| `/` | the Angular SPA, built from `service/src/main/webui` by Quinoa and served by this process (`quarkus.quinoa.ui-root-path=/`); unmatched paths fall back to `index.html`, so the client's own router gets its deep links — including the project-scoped ones, `/qits/events/<id>` — except under the prefix below |
| `/events/api/events` | the REST surface (`quarkus.rest.path=/events/api`) |
| `/events/stream` | the event stream socket — a `@WebSocket` literal, which follows `quarkus.rest.path` for nothing and carries the segment itself |
| `/events/api/stream` | the same fan-out as **Server-Sent Events**, for a browser (`?names=A,B`) — an ordinary JAX-RS route, so it follows `quarkus.rest.path` and needed no configuration anywhere |
| `/events/q/openapi`, `/events/q/swagger-ui` | the API document and its UI (`quarkus.http.non-application-root-path`) |
| `/events/q/health/ready` | the readiness endpoint the deployer's health gate curls |

The edge path-routes verbatim by prefix on **every** vhost — `/events/*` reaches this service from a
sibling application's page too — so the segment is served here or the API is not reachable at all.
There is no unprefixed form; `/events/` itself is a 404, and an old bookmark under it is redirected
by the edge.

The SPA takes everything else, so it is the one that can swallow the rest: the deep-link fallback
answers any unmatched path with `200 text/html`. That is right for a person and wrong for a machine,
which parses `index.html` as garbage data. Quinoa **derives** the exclusion list from
`quarkus.rest.path` and `quarkus.http.non-application-root-path` when the key is unset, and that
derivation was exactly right until `/events/stream` existed — a `@WebSocket` literal follows neither
key. Setting the key **replaces** the derivation rather than extending it, which is why the one
entry has to cover all three routes: the values are matched **after** `ui-root-path` is stripped and
the ui-root is `/`, so `/events` is written absolutely and matches as a prefix. The remaining trap is
websockets-next: it claims only the **upgrade handshake**, so a plain GET on the socket path reaches
no socket route and falls through to the SPA unless the prefix is ignored. Ignoring it does not
unregister the route — the upgrade still works, and `PackagedSurfaceIT` asserts both halves on the
built artifact.

## The bus

**There is one of it.** This is a platform service — `deployment_target: platform`, wire alias
`qits-events` with no tier prefix — so every environment publishes onto and reads from the same
broker. Each environment used to run its own, and that instance *was* the scoping: this service has
no topics and no tenant column, and routing is the event signature plus each consumer's own
watermark. Consumers keep their watermarks in their own `eventstream` databases, so one bus changes
where they dial and nothing about what they have already handled.

Two things make this an event *bus* rather than an event *log*:

    PUT /events/api/events/{id}    idempotent publish under the publisher's own UUID
    ws:  /events/stream            live push of every newly created event
    GET /events/api/stream         the same push as SSE, for a browser

The envelope is one shape in both directions:

```json
{ "name": "BuildSuccessful",
  "occurredAt": "2026-07-31T12:46:03Z",
  "payload": "{\"branch\":\"main\",\"repoId\":\"qits-ci\"}",
  "description": null,
  "parentId": null,
  "environment": "dev" }
```

`payload` is the publishing event class's own fields as **canonical JSON in a string**. This service
stores and compares it verbatim and never reformats it: canonicalization is the publisher's job, and
the equality below is the only reason a retry is safe. `parentId` is envelope, never payload — the
payload is compared byte for byte, so a cause that entered it would make one event published under
two parents two events nothing could reconcile.

**`parentId` and `environment` may be absent, and absent means null.** That is the whole of this
contract's backward
compatibility: a publisher that never learned about the field keeps working, which is why this
service ships before any publisher that stamps. The reverse order is the unsafe one — a stamping
publisher against a service without the column has its parents silently dropped, and chains recorded
as roots cannot be backfilled.

The publish has three answers and no fourth — `201` for an id this log has not seen, `200` for the
same `name`/`occurredAt`/`payload`/`parentId`/`environment` arriving again (nothing written,
nothing pushed),
`400` for an id that exists with anything different, which is a reused UUID and not something a
retry fixes. `description` is deliberately outside that comparison and `parentId` is deliberately
inside it: the line is identity of the occurrence versus prose about it, and two PUTs of one id
claiming different causes are two different claims about history. Two more `400`s belong to the
cause — a `parentId` that is not a canonical UUID, and a `parentId` equal to the event's own id,
since an event cannot cause itself. A `parentId` this log has never seen is **not** one of them.
`POST /events/api/events` stays what it was, for recording something by hand, and takes an optional
`parentId` validated identically so the two write paths cannot diverge about what an event is.

A subscriber connects to `/events/stream` and sends one frame — `{"subscribe": ["BuildSuccessful"]}`,
which *replaces* that connection's set; `["*"]` means everything — and is then pushed
`{"id", "name", "occurredAt", "payload", "description", "parentId", "environment"}` for each newly created matching
event. `name` doubles as the **signature** a subscriber matches on. The field *order* is not part of
the contract — both sides bind by name — but appending is: a subscriber built against the first five
fields reads the frame it always read. Live only, at-most-once: no replay, no offset, no catch-up.
That is a deliberate omission rather than a gap — catch-up reads the event log itself, with
`?order=asc` from the last row the consumer handled — and the envelope carries the id precisely so a
consumer can tell a caught-up row from a live one it already has.

**A browser gets the same push over SSE**, at `GET /events/api/stream?names=BuildSuccessful,BuildFailed`
— `*` for everything, absent for nothing. It is a second *transport*, never a second stream: one
subscription table, one `AFTER_SUCCESS` observer and one serialization of the envelope feed both,
so whatever this route pushes, the socket pushed. Three differences and no fourth:

- **the subscription is in the URL**, because `EventSource` is one-way and has no frame to send; a
  reader that wants different signatures reconnects;
- **each event carries the id in the SSE `id:` field** as well as inside the envelope, which is the
  field the protocol reserves for it and which a browser hands back as `Last-Event-ID`;
- **comment lines** — one at connect (which flushes the response head, so `onopen` fires on a quiet
  signature) and one every 20 seconds (so an idle connection is not reaped by an intermediary).

Its door is the socket's: `qits:admin` or `qits:system`, and a reader without one is **refused at
connect** rather than handed an empty stream — an empty stream is indistinguishable from an idle
estate, and a page that got one would look calm and be blind. The address is under `/events/api`
rather than beside the socket's literal for a reason that is entirely about the trap below: a JAX-RS
`@Path` follows `quarkus.rest.path`, so this route needed no `ignored-path-prefixes` entry and no
edge change, while a plain `GET` with no upgrade header is the request most likely to be swallowed
by the SPA if it ever fell outside the ignored prefix.

## Walking a chain

Two affordances, and there is no third:

    GET /events/api/events/{id}              → the event, whose parentId is its cause  (upwards)
    GET /events/api/events?parentId=<id>     → that event's children, newest first     (downwards)

Downwards is the shape a release train actually has — one release fans out to N builds — and a
client cannot do it without listing the whole log, which is why it is served. An unknown parent is
an **empty list, not a 404**: this log cannot tell a wrong id from one that has not arrived yet, and
"nothing was caused by it as far as I know" is true in both cases. A blank value is treated as
absent, so `?parentId=` is the whole log.

It is a query parameter on the route that already exists, and that is not only economy: a new
literal under `/events` would need an entry in `quarkus.quinoa.ignored-path-prefixes` in the same
commit. This is the one addition that needs none, so this feature does not touch that key at all.

## Reading the log

    GET /events/api/events?limit=200&cursor=<occurredAt>,<id>&name=A,B&since=<instant>&q=<text>
                          &attr=<key>=<value>&attr=<key>=<value>&order=asc|desc
    GET /events/api/events/names   → { "names": ["BuildSuccessful", "SCMRelease", …] }

The list answers a **page**, and its envelope grew one field:

```json
{ "events": [ … ], "nextCursor": "2026-08-01T08:52:23.928965Z,0bdbe98d-…" }
```

`nextCursor` is `null` on the last page, and that null is the only end-of-log signal a client needs.
A full page is not one, and there is no count — the route is asked for one row more than the page
holds, so it knows the answer without a second query. The field was appended to a shape that already
shipped, so a consumer that never reads it reads the list it always read.

| | |
|---|---|
| `limit` | page size. Absent is **200**, above **1000** is 1000, anything that is not a whole number ≥ 1 is a `400`. The clamp is silent-safe: the page says what it holds and whether more exist |
| `cursor` | `<occurredAt>,<id>` — the last row of the previous page |
| `name` | comma-separated, the **same vocabulary** a subscribe frame names, so a filter means one thing live and one thing historically |
| `since` | inclusive lower bound on `occurredAt`. There is deliberately no `until`: the cursor **is** the upper bound |
| `q` | case-insensitive substring of the payload |
| `attr` | repeatable `key=value`, ANDed. An exact, case-insensitive match of the fragment `"key":"value"` in the payload — string-valued keys of events published through `CanonicalJson` only, and, like `q`, a scan rather than an indexed lookup. A value with no `=` is a `400` naming the parameter |
| `order` | `asc` (oldest first) or `desc`. Absent is `desc`, the reading this route has always answered. Anything else is a `400` naming the parameter |

**The cursor is composite, and that is the whole design of it.** `occurredAt` is not unique and
cannot be made unique — the events one pipeline run publishes carry the run's finish instant, so a
fork's siblings tie by construction — and a scalar `before=<occurredAt>` cursor whose boundary lands
on a tie either repeats a sibling or drops one, on precisely the rows a release train is read for.
The pair supports `occurred_at < :at or (occurred_at = :at and id < :id)`, which has no such gap. The
list's sort carries the id for the same reason: without it a tied pair comes back in whatever order
the database picked this time, and the log's order is not reproducible across two identical requests.

**`order=asc` is the same page read forward, and it exists for durable consumers.** A consumer that
tracks what it has handled keeps the last row it processed as a **watermark**, and after a restart or
a cutover it has to read *forward* from that row to the head — the events it missed while it was not
listening. Descending cannot express that: it walks away from the watermark, so the consumer would
have to page all of history back to its own position and reverse it. Ascending flips the sort **and
the cursor comparison** together:

    desc:  occurred_at < :at or (occurred_at = :at and id < :id)
    asc:   occurred_at > :at or (occurred_at = :at and id > :id)

Both halves turn round, which is what keeps a fork's siblings splitting cleanly across a page
boundary in either direction — a `before`/`after` cursor over `occurredAt` alone is lossy both ways.
`nextCursor` is still the page's last row, so a consumer stores it as its watermark and sends it back
verbatim; the row it names is excluded and nothing beside it is. Every filter composes unchanged, and
a request that says nothing about order gets exactly what it always got. An `order` this service
cannot read is a `400` rather than a fallback to `desc`: answering a catch-up consumer with the head
of the log would let it record a watermark it never reached.

**`q` searches the payload as a string and parses nothing.** There is no one key that means "which
repository" — a build names it under `repoId`, a release under `repository` — so `q=qits-stt` finds
all of them, over-matches slightly, and is named for what it is. The server's stance that the payload
is opaque is what makes the idempotent publish's byte-for-byte comparison true, and no read is worth
giving it up.

**`attr` is the exact question `q` cannot answer, at the price of naming the key.** `?attr=name=value`
matches the literal `"name":"value"` — closing quote included, so `attr=packageType=dae` does **not**
match a value of `daemon` — and repeating it ANDs the filters. It still parses no payload: the server
builds a literal whose shape the platform's own canonical publisher guarantees (alphabetically-sorted
keys, string values quoted), rather than reading the payload as JSON, so it is honest only for
string-valued keys of events published through `CanonicalJson`, and it is a scan like `q`, not an
index. Blank entries are dropped, the rule `?parentId=` already follows, and a value with no `=` is a
`400` naming the parameter. No migration, no index, no new route — this is a query parameter on the
route that already exists, the same as every filter above it.

**`environment` is the one filter that is an indexed equality.** The tier is envelope data on its
own column, so `?environment=dev` never touches the payload; a value that could never have been
stored — not a dns-safe name — is a `400` naming the parameter, and blank is absent like everywhere
else. Events from before the field carry null and match no filter value.

**`?parentId=` takes none of these and is answered whole.** A parent's children are one per artifact
a pipeline declares — bounded by a file in a repository rather than by history — so its `nextCursor`
is always `null`.

`/names` is `select distinct name order by name`. It is a route because the alternative is fetching
all of history to learn five strings, which is the thing paging exists to stop; it is a literal
beside the `/{id}` template, and JAX-RS matches literal characters first, which the suite pins rather
than trusts. Both live under `/events/api`, so `quarkus.quinoa.ignored-path-prefixes` is untouched.

## The client

[qits-events-platform-frontend](https://github.com/QuicklyIterateTheSoftware/qits-events-platform-frontend)
— Angular 21, standalone components, no SSR — is a submodule at `service/src/main/webui`, which is
Quinoa's default `web-ui-dir`, so the path is a convention rather than a setting. Its `angular.json` sets
`baseHref` to `"/"`, because the client owns the root of this host — so the client spells no segment
at all, and there is nothing left for it to disagree with.

The segment survives in **four** spellings, all of them in this repository and all checkable by a
build here: `quarkus.quinoa.ignored-path-prefixes`, `quarkus.rest.path`,
`quarkus.http.non-application-root-path`, and `routes:` in `.config/qits/deployments.yml`.

That gives this repo a clone rule with two halves:

    git clone … && git submodule update --init

- **The test suite needs neither node nor the submodule.** Quinoa is disabled by default in test
  mode (`Quinoa is disabled by default in tests.`), so all 112 `@QuarkusTest`s are green against an
  empty `webui/` on a machine with no node at all — `./mvnw test`, measured.
- **Anything that reaches `package` needs both**, and that includes `./mvnw verify`, which runs
  `package` on its way to failsafe. An uninitialised gitlink is an *empty directory*, and that is
  the one case Quinoa treats as a misconfiguration rather than "no client": augmentation stops at
  `No package.json found in Web UI directory`.

  The platform reference (`docs/project-setup-quinoa-angular.md`) says `mvn verify` needs neither;
  that is true of the *tests* it runs and not of the goal, and it holds for every SPA-serving
  service, not just this one. `./mvnw test` is the command the clone-alone rule actually names here.

The client depends on `@qits/ui-components`, which exists only on the platform's own npm registry,
`https://registry.qits.$QITS_DOMAIN/artifacts/npm/npm/`, and that answers 401 without a credential
the image build is not handed. So the image build does not build the client: the platform's pipeline
step builds it and `docker/Dockerfile` packages the bundle it was handed. Every SPA-serving service
in the platform does this, for the same reason.

## Configuration

The `events` jar ships its defaults at ordinal 100
(`events/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`); `service`'s
`application.properties` is the app's own at 250; `.env` is 295 and real environment is 300.

Storage is **declared, not configured**. `.config/qits/deployments.yml` carries one line —

    resources: postgresql:db

— and qits-platform-deployments creates the role and the database (`qits_events`, derived from the
application name) on the platform environment's PostgreSQL — this is a platform service, so it has
no tier of its own — before the successor container starts, then injects

    QITS_RESOURCE_DB_URL / QITS_RESOURCE_DB_USERNAME / QITS_RESOURCE_DB_PASSWORD

which is what the jar's datasource defaults expand. Those three names are the platform's generic
resource contract; nothing about them is events-specific.

The triple has no fallback. An unconfigured `docker run` leaves the expressions unresolvable and the
process dies at Flyway's first connect naming the missing variable — the honest behaviour, and the
same refuse-to-boot stance the siblings take.

## Authentication

Two ways in, and `@RolesAllowed` decides for both:

- **Forward-auth headers.** The edge turns a browser session into `X-Qits-User` /
  `X-Qits-Roles`. In-network callers on `qits-net` send the same two headers themselves, with no
  token. qits-auth-core's `ForwardAuthMechanism` reads them.
- **A person's bearer token.** A person's command-line tool calls through the edge with that
  person's token. The edge strips forward-auth headers from such a request, so `quarkus-oidc`
  validates the token instead, and its `groups` claim becomes the roles.

A request with neither is anonymous, and every protected route refuses it with 401. See
`AGENTS.md`.

`qits:admin-agent` — an admin workspace's agent (qits-628 follow-up) — is admitted wherever
`qits:admin` is.
